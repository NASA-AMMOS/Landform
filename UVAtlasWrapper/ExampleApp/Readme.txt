Mono Game is an open source port of the depricated Xna framework.

The classes in this directory have been modified slightly to be double instead of float, but are otherwise minimally altererd.

The classes in this directory have been modified slightly to be double instead of float, but are otherwise minimally altererd.

It is expected that over time we may want to refresh these classes with updated versions from Mono Game as they are improved.

Anywhere new methods have been added to the class they are wrapped in a "CustomExtensions" region.

ImageLib.Geometry.Extensions also contains extension methods for convienence.

OpenGL quaternion ops (think these are left handed)

See also this library with possibly better quaternion and matrix operations.  This is another port of some xna stuff and monogame may be immitating this code.
